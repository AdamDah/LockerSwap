Private swaps using ZKBob ans 1inch

# Private Swap DEX üîÑüîê

## Overview

This project aims to create a secure and private way for users to execute token swaps using Zero-Knowledge Proof Bulletproofs (zk-SNARKs) for private transfers and leverage the 1inch protocol for efficient swaps. The smart contract will also support cross-chain implementations for various blockchains, including Gnosis, Arbitrum, Metamask, Chiliz, Scroll, Mantle, ZkSync, and Neon EVM.

## Features

- **Decentralized Frontend**: The frontend is hosted on BOS of Near and is fully decentralized.
- **Private Swaps**: Utilize zk-SNARKs (zk-Bulletproofs) for confidential and private token transfers.
- **Efficient Swaps**: Leverage the 1inch protocol for optimized and cost-effective token swaps.
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Deploy the smart contract on multiple chains, including Gnosis, Arbitrum, Metamask, Chiliz, Scroll, Mantle, ZkSync, and Neon EVM.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract facilitates private token swaps and can be deployed on various blockchains. It supports the creation of private swap orders and finds matches for opposite swap parameters.

### Usage

1. **Create a Swap Order**: Users can create a swap order by specifying the token they want to offer, the amount, and the token they want in return with the corresponding amount.
2. **Private Matching**: The smart contract uses zk-SNARKs to confidentially find matching swap orders.
3. **Efficient Execution**: Utilizes 1inch protocol for efficient and optimized token swaps.
4. **Cross-Chain Implementation**: Deploy the smart contract on supported blockchains for cross-chain swaps.
